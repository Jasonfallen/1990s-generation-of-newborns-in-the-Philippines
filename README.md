# Introduction

# Project

Immunization is our very first step into the new world. At the moment that we are born, the midwife will give us the first dose of the HepB vaccine to help us build immunity against the Hepatitis B virus. Later in the first three years, a variety of vaccines will be injected into the babies' bodies to help them prepare for the upcoming challenges from viruses and bacteria that might cause death threats and even lifelong sequelae if they are not vaccinated. This repo convert one full-page table from one DHS Program ‘Final Report’, from the 1980s or 1990s, into a usable dataset, then write a short paper telling a story with the data.

# Data Source

The 1998 NDHS gathered information on immunization coverage for all children born within  the five years before the survey to aid in the national evaluation of the Expanded Program  on Immunization (EPI), which includes the whole population of the nation. Tuberculosis  (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio are especially investigated  in the survey

The data set is open source in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program website (https://dhsprogram.com/search/index.cfm?_srchd=1&bydoctype=publication&bypubtype=26%2C5%2C39%2C30%2C21%2C100&byyear=1999&byyear=1998&byyear=1997&byyear=1996&byyear=1995&byyear=1994&byyear=1993&byyear=1992&byyear=1991&byyear=1990&byyear=1989&byyear=1988&byyear=1987&bylanguage=2).
