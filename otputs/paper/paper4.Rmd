abstract: "In 1998 NDHS gathered information on immunization coverage for all children born within the five years including their vaccination of  Tuberculosis (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio. The birth order, residence and mother's education level shows a strong relation to the infants' immunization rate. The earlier birth order, urban residency and higher mother's education benefit the health of newborns. To enhance further vaccine equality and ensure every infants receive full immunization at the recommended time, NDHS should probably promote the awareness of the infant's family in importance of immunization."

# Introduction

Immunization is our very first step into the new world. At the moment that we are born, the midwife will give us the first dose of the HepB vaccine to help us build immunity against the Hepatitis B virus. Later in the first three years, a variety of vaccines will be injected into the babies' bodies to help them prepare for the upcoming challenges from viruses and bacteria that might cause death threats and even lifelong sequelae if they are not vaccinated.   
  
Infants are especially vulnerable to virus infections; that's why protecting them with vaccine immunizations is one of the most important things for society. In 1998, the NDHS (National Demographic and Health Survey) especially used a section to investigate infant immunization for babies born in 1993 to 1998, those who were born at most five years before the survey. They checked into these infant vaccines: tuberculosis (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio. They also recorded the family and parents' background characteristics to see if these characteristics influenced the vaccinations, which included birth order, family residence, regions, and the mother's education. The data will be explained in detail in the Data section, including how it was collected and what we can learn from it. 
  
This paper is mainly divided into four parts. First, in the data section, the table data is introduced, together with the survey methodology and the variable definitions. Then the cleaned data will be visualized and interpreted in the Results section. Third, in the Discussion section, there will be some conclusive insights, useful measures to help more newborns be immunized, and future steps that people might try. Finally, in the appendix, the completed data sheet (Gebru et al., 2021) will be attached, along with the supplementary survey that the table is related to.

# Looking into the data  
##  Survey Methodology  
The 1998 NDHS gathered information on immunization coverage for all children born within the five years before the survey to aid in the national evaluation of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), which includes the whole population of the nation. Tuberculosis (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio are especially investigated in the survey.   

The mother, who had a child, was asked if she had a health card for each of her children, and if she did, the interviewer requested the family to show it. If a mother could provide the interviewer with her baby's health record card, the interviewer transcribed the vaccination dates from the card onto the questionnaire and recorded all the vaccine immunization information. Some other details, such as the babies' gender, the birth order of the children, and the family residence, were also documented.  

There were also a large number of children who had never received a health immunization card or whose mother was unable to show the card to the interviewer. Actually, only 41 percent of children had health cards, which gave the interviewer a valuable piece of written evidence. And for the last 59% of children, the mother was asked if the child had received vaccinations against specific diseases. The information mostly depended on the mother's memory and report.  

According to the EPI program, basic infant immunizations, including one dose of BCG, one dose of measles, three doses of DPT, and three doses of the polio vaccine, must be taken before each infant turns one year old. If these basic vaccines are successfully given to a child within this time, he or she is considered to be fully vaccinated. And this is also the main aim of the EPI program, that is, to ensure every child receives the full dose of vaccines at the right time.   

Table 1 (C. Lee Ventola, 2016; Chika N et al.,2022; Partho Roy et al., 2019) lists the appropriate vaccination time, vaccination effects and the Decline in the Morbidity of Diseases due to Vaccination of  BCG, measles, DPT (three doses), and polio(three doses). 

\newpage

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

res <- data.frame(Vaccines=c("BCG", "Measles", "DPT (three doses)", "Polio (three doses)"), 
                  Time=c("At birth", "In USA, given at 12-15 months; in Phillipines,given before one year old", "When at two, four and six months","When at two, four and six-eighteen months"),

                  "MorbidityDecline" = c("94%","99.9%","100.0%","100.0%"))
                  
knitr::kable(res, caption="Infant vaccination time, the vaccination effects and the Decline in the Morbidity of Diseases due to Vaccination (Vaccination time may vary by different countries)",align = "clllc")
```

Receiving the correct dose of the vaccine at the recommended time is crucial. Any late vaccination may result in reduced efficacy of the vaccination, interfere with subsequent vaccinations and, most seriously, may result in the risk of exposure to the life-threating virus. This makes the nationwide vaccination so urgent and important. However, according to the survey results, only 73 percent of children are fully immunized.  

\newpage  
## Cleaned Table  
The cleaned table is as follows:  

Table 2 shows the percentages of infants who received vaccines for DPT (1, 2, or 3 doses), polio (1, 2, or 3 doses), and measles vaccines. The columns include different vaccine types. The rows have shown the family characteristics categorized by the babies' gender, the birth order of the children, the family residence, and the education level of the mother.  

Table 3 shows the percentages of infants who received full immunization, no immunization, percentage of infants who had a health card, and number of children under certain background characteristics. The rows have shown the family characteristics categorized by the babies' gender, the birth order of the children, the family residence, and the education level of the mother.

           width = 0.5,size = 0.5)+
  labs(x="Gender",y="Percentage",title = "Figure 1. Infants vaccination percentage categorized by gender")
data1 <- melt(data1,id.vars = 'X')


```

There was no significant difference in the vaccination status of newborns by gender. In general, for the same vaccine, male infants were vaccinated very similarly to female infants. For Polio3 and DPT3, both of which have lower vaccination rates, males and females showed consistency here. For infants who did not receive a single dose of the vaccine, the rate was slightly higher for males.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,results="hide"}
data2 <- data[3:6,1:11]
library(tidyverse)

data2 %>%

           width = 0.5,size = 0.5)+
  labs(x="Birth order",y="Percentage",title = "Figure 2. Infants vaccination percentage categorized by birth order")

```
In terms of birth order, the vaccination of newborns shows a certain pattern. As birth order goes up, the later the child is born, the more likely it is that he or she will be influenced by a reduced probability of vaccination. Also, as birth order increases, the probability of children without immunization gradually increases, showing a strong positive correlation. This may caused by the economic pressure or reduced parenting time associated with multi-child families.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,results="hide"}
data3 <- data[7:8,1:11]

           width = 0.5,size = 0.5)+
  labs(x="Residence",y="Percentage",title = "Figure 3. Infants vaccination percentage categorized by residence")

```
For different residence, urban-born children have better immunization status than the rural-born children. For  BCG, DPT (1, 2, or 3 doses), polio (1, 2, or 3 doses), and measles, this pattern could be shown in Figure 3.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,results="hide"}

           width = 0.5,size = 0.5)+
  labs(x="Mother's education",y="Percentage",title = "Figure 4. Infants vaccination percentage categorized by mother's education")

```
The educational level of mothers also increased the rate of vaccination of children. In terms of the four education levels, no education, primary education, high school education, and college or higher, the higher the education level of mothers, the better their children's vaccination percentage will be. This may be related to the mother's earning level, scientific knowledge, etc.

# Discussion 
## Conclusions in vaccine types
Regardless of all kinds of family background characteristics, there are a few overall patterns in vaccination percentage in Table 2 and Table 3. The vaccines that require more than one dose result in a lower vaccination percentage than the one-dose shot. The BCG vaccine seems to have the highest vaccination percentage of all the fully-injected vaccines for all backgrounds. This may be due to the time that BCG is vaccinated, the moment when the child is born, whereas the DPT and polio require three injections, and measles is usually injected later than 9 months. The coverage rate for the first dose of DPT is also very close to, or sometimes higher than, the BCG coverage rate, which is close to about 90% coverage. Approximately 72.8 percent of children are fully vaccinated, which is slightly higher than previous EPI data.      

The reason why the number of people who receive the measles vaccine couldn’t reach other kinds of vaccine is probably that the measles vaccine is normally given at nine to twelve months. Its late injection may be the reason that it has a lower vaccination rate than others. However, the question of low measles vaccination has seen its negative impact on the Philippines' society (FM Domai et al., 2022). From 2017 to 2019, the Philippines was hit by the largest measles outbreak in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific region. This pandemic has confirmed about 31,056 cases with more than 400 deaths, among which the most fatal cases were young children. Children under the age of 9 months account for 41% of all deaths (FM Domai et al., 2022). At that time, the measles vaccination rate had dropped to 75%, even lower than the 78.9% that was investigated in this survey in 1998. The declining measles vaccination rate has presented the Philippine society with a significant challenge in protecting their young generation from the dangers of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections.  

There are mainly two problems that can be seen in Table 2 and Table 3: children who have never received a vaccine or have not fully received it, as well as the low percentage of kids who have a health card.         

We should be aware that 7.7 percent of children in total have never received any immunizations after birth. This may lead to the potential danger of exposure to some very terrible children's diseases, which may cause paralysis (which the BCG vaccine could prevent) and death. It’s very urgent to ensure those children get primary immunizations. The other thing that should be mentioned is that there is about a 10% drop rate between the first dose and the third dose for both DPT vaccines and Polio vaccines. Fully-vaccinated children can’t build enough antibodies to defend themselves against viruses. Just like the COVID-19 vaccines that we have experienced, basically, the first dose of the vaccine starts the process of building up protection, and the second dose induces a strong immune response to greatly reinforce this protection. It’s very essential to make sure the children’s family strictly follows the infants’ vaccination process and schedule. What we can do to ensure this point will be discussed in the further sections.  

And the survey also has a problem with collecting information. Only about 41% of the children whose information was gathered from the data were identified. The rest of the children's immunization records are derived from the parents’ reports. Their health card may have gone missing, or they may not have received one at all. This may cause a certain degree of inaccuracy and misreporting of the results of the survey. In the promotion of children's health, the child health card is a relatively accurate and effective written record. It keeps track of birth information, weight gain, immunizations, neurological development, and illness episodes. (1984, Donald PR et al.) It may also play an important role in the early detection and prevention of disease in newborns and children in some cases. The immunization information of children may be benefited by further promoting the application of health cards.    

## Looking into the family background characteristics
In the results section, the five main family background characteristics have been separately visualized and briefly concluded: gender, birth order, residence, mother’s education level, and family region.  

Among these five characteristics, the plot shows that there is no strong significance for different genders. In general, for the same vaccine, the coverage rate of male infants' vaccination is very similar to that of female infants.  

When looking into the birth orders, the later the child is born, the more likely he or she will not be fully vaccinated. The vaccine coverage rate has a strong negative association with birth order. And the percentage of infants who have never received vaccinations but are the sixth child of the family or later has increased by four times more than those who are the firstborn. Why do later-born children have worse vaccinations than early-born? The reason might be the parenting time. The mothers from larger families would have had less for each individual. And the financial strain of having more kids may cause parents to spend more time at work, thus decreasing the time with their children. The neglance of children’s immunization is induced under these conditions.  

In terms of residence, urban-born children have better immunization status than rural-born children. A better medical system with a higher density of vaccination clinics may lead to more convenient injections. For families living in rural areas, the long-distance from home to the clinic may make parents hesitant about whether to spend the time getting their children vaccinated. In addition, the importance of vaccination is less publicized in rural areas than in urban areas. This may also make the families less aware of the significance of vaccination. To some extent, this is also potentially relevant to the mother's education level, which we discuss below.   

The educational level of mothers increased the rate of vaccination of children. In terms of the four education levels (no education, primary education, high school education, and college or higher), the higher the education level of mothers, the better their children’s vaccination percentage will be. The higher the level of education the mother has, the more likely she will vaccinate her child. This might be because some mothers of lower education couldn’t fully acknowledge the role vaccines play in their children’s immunizations or have concerns about vaccine safety. And whether mothers are employed and have access to a regular monthly income may also possibly contribute to the higher vaccination rate.  

## Weaknesses and next steps
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

res <- data.frame(Reasons=c("Unaware of need for immunization","Unaware of need to return for second or third dose ","Fear of side effects, wrong ideas about contraindieations ","Postponed until another time ","No faith in immunization ","Rumors ","Place of immunization too far ","Time for immunization inconvenient ","Vaccinator absent ","Mother too busy ","Family problem, including illness of mother ","Child ill - not brought ","Child ill - brought but not given immunization ","Long waiting time ","Other ","No reason given"), 
                  Percents=c("4.3","2.2","9.2","6.9","5.5","1.3","15.5","2.6","2.0","13.2","1.3","9.9","1.8","1.0","10.5","29.7"))
                  
knitr::kable(res, caption="Reasons for children's non-immunization",align = "lc")
```
Table 4 lists the most common reasons for parents' failure to bring their children to get the vaccination. The inconvenience of going to a health facility or finding the time to accompany the child to the clinic appears to be the major impediment to completing the basic immunization among the sixteen reasons.  

To find a solution to the inconvenience of getting to a health facility, the easiest way could be to open more vaccination sites, whether temporary or permanent. Alternatively, the Department of Health could give some small payments to encourage families to get their kids vaccinated or to cover the transportation fee for taking a ride. The health department of the Philippines could also organize some regular vaccination campaigns in those rural areas where the vaccination sites are limited. Financial incentives may be helpful to those families who have transportation problems.  

Some parents have difficulty finding the time to accompany their children to the clinic. To address this, the clinic could probably add extra time on weekday nights or weekends. The regular time may have conflicted with the parents' working time. This extra time could help them better arrange vaccination appointments. Financial incentives also work for families in poverty to cover the loss of family income from taking their children to clinics. Working parents should be able to attend clinic or health facility hours that are convenient for them. Every community should have at least one 'walk-in' clinic that could provide children's vaccines without an appointment on specific days. This could make it easier for parents to get their children vaccinated.  

In summary, there are a variety of ways to increase coverage rates for children's vaccinations. The important thing is to get all the infants to receive the appropriate vaccine at the right time. As Nelson Mandela has said, it's impossible until it's done.
